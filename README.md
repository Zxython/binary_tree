# binary_tree
This is a very simple package I made

To install just run this command in your terminal

pip install https://github.com/Zxython/binary_tree/archive/refs/heads/main.zip
  
-----------------------------------------------------------------------
Alternatively 
1) download this as a zip file
2) navigate to the file in file explorer
3) copy the path to the zip file
4) It should look like this C:\Users\USER\Downloads\binary_tree-main.zip
5) in pycharm terminal type pip install C:\Users\USER\Downloads\binary_tree-main.zip

-----------------------------------------------------------------------

To import it type

from binary_tree.binary_tree import binary_tree as tree

for instructions on how to use it type

tree.help.all()
