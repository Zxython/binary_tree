# binary_tree
This is a very simple class I made for creating a binary tree in python

To install just run this command in your terminal

  pip install git+https://github.com/Zxython/binary_tree

If you need git you can downoad it from here

  https://git-scm.com/downloads

Or if you are using anaconda you can use this command in your terminal

conda install git pip

-----------------------------------------------------------------------

If you're on pycharm
1) Open pycharm
2) go to packages and search for pip
3) install pip
4) go to pycharm terminal located at bottom of pycharm
5) type in pip install git+https://github.com/Zxython/binary_tree
