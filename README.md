# binary_tree
This is a very simple class I made for creating a binary tree in python

To install just run this pycharm command in your terminal
pip install git+https://github.com/Zxython/binary_tree

To use simply type from 
binary_tree.binary_tree import binary_tree as tree

for help type
tree.help.all()
