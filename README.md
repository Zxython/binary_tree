# binary_tree
This is a very simple class I made for creating a binary tree in python

To install just run this command in your terminal


conda install git

pip install git+https://github.com/Zxython/binary_tree


If you're on pycharm
1) Open pycharm
2) go to packages and search for pip
3) install pip
4) go to pycharm terminal located at bottom of pycharm
5) type in pip install git+https://github.com/Zxython/binary_tree

To use simply type from 
binary_tree.binary_tree import binary_tree as tree

for help type
tree.help.all()
